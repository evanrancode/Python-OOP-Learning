# Cars Class 

This is a simple Python script that defines a `Cars` class to represent different car objects with attributes such as make, model, age, mileage, and price.

The script demonstrates how to:
- Create class and instance attributes.
- Instantiate multiple car objects.
- Access and modify class-level attributes.
- Display basic information about each car.

**Cars.py**  
Contains the `Cars` class definition and a short script that:
1. Creates three car objects (`car_1`, `car_2`, and `car_3`).
2. Modifies the engine type and condition for one of the cars.
3. Prints each carâ€™s name, condition, and engine type.
